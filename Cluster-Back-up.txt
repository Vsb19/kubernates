1.Quering the Kube Api Server:
kubectl get all -all-namespaces -o yml > all-deploy-services.yml
Referrence Link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEiRS3rgdX4

Cluster upgrade:
Back up:
All the Certificates are located in /etc/kubernetes/pki
All the certificates related to etcd server are placed in:  /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd


S1--> create a directory for storing back ups
mkdir my-backups

S2-->Backing up the TLS certificates & cluster components:
*Copy the certificates :cp -r /etc/kubernates/pki to created directory

S3-->Creating back up for etcd server:
*In order to intreact with etcdctl we need to install etcd controll client to be installed

Download the package form:
go get github.com/coreos/etcd/etcdctl

* check weather etcdctl is installed or not, by clicking etcdctl on u r console.


S4-->To save the snapshot of etcdctl server:

  ETCDCTL_API=3 \

> etcdctl snapshot save [Directory-name]/[give some name to file(snapshot.db)] \

> --endpoints=https://[Master node ip]:2379 \  #(2379 is default port no for etcd)

> --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \ #[Path for CA certificate]

> --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.crt \  #[Path for TLS Cerificate]

> --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/healthcheck-client.key  #[Path for TLS key ]

To Restore the cluster from the back ups
S1--> cp -r my-backup[Directory created by us]/pki /etc/kubernates [Copying the back up files to the originl path]


S2-->ETCDCT_API=3 \
>etcdctl snapshot restore my-backups[directoy created]/snapshot.db

--> The file get restore in a specific path:
   default.etcd/member/snap

S3-->Move the file:
mv default.etcd/member /var/lib/etcd

S4-->Chect the file got moved 
mv default.etcd/member /var/lib/etcd

S5-->Execute Command:
kubeadm init --ignore-preflight-errors=DirAvailable--var-lib-etcd
